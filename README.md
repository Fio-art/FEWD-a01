##Introduction:
Hola I'm **Fio** A Escondido based _**designer.**_


Layout Design is my passion, from print to screen. My time working with a company with several brands and clients, plus my time as a senior editorial designer has helped me to produce quick turn aorund layouts, content architecture and optimization for marketing campaings, etc.


Also, here's a quick list of other things I love do:
* Bowling
* Cross-stiching
* Water Colors
* Jewerly Making
* Ceramics
* Collect Barbies
* Sit at the beach or park :)
